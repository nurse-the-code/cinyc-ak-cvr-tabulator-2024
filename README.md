# AK-CVR
Code to parse AK Cast Vote Records.

Run AK CVR Marks Converter.py first to convert the AK json file(s) to a csv, then run AK CVR Tabulator.py to convert marks to ranks.

Script is very basic - for now, with no input functionality, and must be manually changed for each race.

In the tabulator, py. Edit candidates for relevant candidate numbers and ex-list to change order of eliminated candidates. 

In both, the C:\\\Path\\\to\\\file must be changed to your file location.
